# Java-Project-OOP
I created a Bakery Management software which implements all basics of Object Oriented Programming. It functions includes 1) Order a Product+Bill creation 2) Adding a new Product 3) Deleting an existing product 4) Writing data into a .ser file .  It is a very basic application which I created to submit as a class project for my OOP subject.
